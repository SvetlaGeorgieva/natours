// Serving static files
// express.static() defines a folder which we can access to serve static files. Serves only files, not folders (can serve 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/img/pin.png', but can't serve 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/img/')

// Defining our own middleware
// The order of middlewares matters. If it ts defined after a request-response cycle has ended (when a handler function sends the response), it won't be called, it won't be a part of the middleware stack. So global middleware functions are declared before the handler functions, if we want them to be executed.
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Hello from the middleware ðŸ‘‹');
  // NB!!! Always use next() at the end of the middleware. Otherwise we will never exit the middleware.

// create a middleware to add the request time to the response object
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  req.requestTime = new Date().toISOString();
  next();
