# Natours

> A node.js website application with dynamic data where you can browse, rate and book different tours.

By building this project I am learning Node.js, Express and MongoDB.

## How to setup and run this project

- **Install Node.js version 10+**

- **Fork and clone repository**

- **Create MongoDB hosted database**

  - Log in (or create account) at [MongoDB Atlas](https://account.mongodb.com/account/login).
  - Under Projects -> Create new project. Give it a name (ex. natours), give yourself 'Project Owner' permissions
  - Click on the button 'Build a Database'. Select the free option. You can use the default settings for a free cluster. At the end of the page, click on 'Create Cluster' button.

- **Connect app to your hosted batabase**

  - A 'Security Quickstart' page should open up. If not, on Cluster0 click the 'Connect' button.
  - Add your current IP address (there is a button for this), so that your computer could connect to this cluster.
  - Create MongoDB username and password (fill in the username and password input fields and click on 'Create User').
  - Use your password to set your `DATABASE_PASSWORD` variable in your 'config.env' file. **See under section 'Configuration' for details!**
  - On Cluster0 click the 'Connect' button.
  - Click the button 'Choose Connection Method'. Choose 'Connect Your Application'.
  - Driver -> Node.js. Version -> latest one of the list
  - Copy the connection string. Use this string to construct the value of the `DATABASE` variable in your 'config.env' file. Make sure to use your username and database name. **See under section 'Configuration' for details!**

- **Fill your database with data**

  > Note: Dev database data (for tours, reviews, users) is located at './dev-data/data/'. We can import it with a specially implemented JS command. Keep in mind that the dev data has already encrypted passwords, so we don't want to encrypt on top of that. The instructions below handle this.

  - Manually disable (comment out) all pre-save middlewares in './models/userModel.js' -> this will disable the password encryption on save/update. They all start with `userSchema.pre('save'` .
  - In terminal, from project's root folder run:
    - `npm install` -> to install all dependencies
    - `node ./dev-data/data/import-dev-data.js --import`
    - If successful, you will see message _Data successfully loaded!_
  - Go back to './models/userModel.js' and manually enable (uncomment) all pre-save middlewares again.
  - To delete all database data, you can run command:  
    `node ./dev-data/data/import-dev-data.js --delete`
  - If successful, you will see message _Data successfully deleted!_

- **SMTP settings**

  - To capture SMTP traffic from our dev environment, we can use a service like 'Mailtrap'. We will use the username, password, host to configure the application as described in section _Configuration_.

  - Example with Mailtrap:
    > - create new account on [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/)
    > - Tab 'Inboxes' -> create new project and give it a name (like 'natours')
    > - Under tab 'SMTP Settings' -> click on 'Show Credentials' -> there you will find your username, password, host and port settings.
    > - Use these values to replace variables `EMAIL_USERNAME`, `EMAIL_PASSWORD`, `EMAIL_HOST` and `EMAIL_PORT` in your 'config.env' file. **See under section 'Configuration' for details!**

- **Configuration**

  - Create `'config.env'` file in the top folder (next to package.json)

  - To fill `'config.env'` with data, use `'sample_config.env'` file in the top folder as a basis.

  - Replace variables:

    > - `DATABASE` -> Replace your username, database name and MongoDB cluster name
    > - `DATABASE_PASSWORD` -> Replace your MongoDB database password
    > - `JWT_SECRET` -> Can be any string you want. Simply make it a little longer, around 30-50 characters long. Like `some-very-very-long-string-for-your-secret`
    > - `EMAIL_USERNAME` -> Set to your SMTP username
    > - `EMAIL_PASSWORD` -> Set to your SMTP password
    > - `EMAIL_HOST` -> Set to your SMTP host. `EMAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io` if you are using Mailtrap.
    > - `EMAIL_PORT` -> Set to your SMTP port. `EMAIL_PORT=25` if you are using Mailtrap.

- **Run the project locally**
  - `npm install` -> to install all dependencies
  - `npm run build` -> to package the javascript files with Parcel
  - `npm run start` -> to start the server
  - The app will be running on port 3000
